# Mathdown
## Rmarkdown for Mathematica.


### Overview
The **mathdown** script imitates the basic functionality of RMarkdown but for Mathematica (Wolfram Language).


### Installation
Clone this repo and execute mathdown.py.


### Usage
$> python mathdown.py your_file.Mmd

Where *your_file.Mmd* is a Markdown file containing Mathematica code chunks. Each chunk
must start with three backquotes (`) followed by the "{Mathematica}" tag on the first
line, and end with a line containing only three backquotes.


### Example
This README.md file was generated from README.Mmd, also available in the repo.
```{Mathematica}
Print["This is a chunk."]
Range[10]
var = 2;
```

Mathdown retains variables across chunks:

```{Mathematica}
var
var = 3
```

Mathdown calls Export[] on Graphics[] output to convert them to .jpg and save them in a
separate folder. (Here we manually insert the image so that this README is
complete. Locally, the figures are stored in the your_file-figures/ folder.)

```{Mathematica}
Plot[x^var, {x, 0, 10}]
```
