# Test some basic outputs

This chunk tests some basic Markdown features as well as Mathematica numeric outputs.
Implicitly, we're also testing for correct whitespace.

Such as integers and lists,

```{Mathematica}
Range[10]
```

big integers, decimals, scientific notation,

```{Mathematica}
16^4^4
N[Pi, 30]
Pi/10000000000 // N
```

fractions, exponents,

```{Mathematica}
(Sqrt[5] + 1)/2
Integrate[x^2, x]
```

and more complicated expressions

```{Mathematica}
\[Integral]x Sqrt[x^3 - 1] \[DifferentialD] x
```
